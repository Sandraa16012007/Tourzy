# 🌍 Tourzy – A Travel Journal (My First React Project with Vite)

Tourzy is a simple and visually engaging travel journal web application built using **React + Vite**. This project marks my first step into the React ecosystem, where I explored concepts like **components**, **props**, and **dynamic rendering of data**.

## ✨ Features
- 🗺️ Displays travel destinations with images and location icons  
- 📅 Shows travel dates, titles, and descriptions  
- ⚛ Built using **React functional components** and **JSX**  
- ⚡ Powered by **Vite** for fast development and hot reload  
- 🎨 Styled using custom CSS for clean, minimal UI

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project helped me practice:
- **Component-based architecture**
- **Reusable UI blocks**
- **Passing and rendering props**
- **Creating a responsive layout using custom CSS**
- **Understanding modern frontend structure**

> 🚀 _This is the beginning of my React journey, and Tourzy is my first milestone!_

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
